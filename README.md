# VulnScan-AI

**VulnScan-AI** is an AI-powered vulnerability management and scanning framework designed to analyze GitHub repositories for insecure code, outdated dependencies, and security misconfigurations. It leverages LLMs (like GPT-4), GitHub's API, and agentic AI workflows to automate vulnerability detection, enrichment, and remediation suggestions.

---

## 🔐 Key Features

- 🔍 **GitHub Repository Scanner** – Scans repositories for known CVEs, exposed secrets, and insecure functions.
- 🧠 **LLM-Powered Enrichment** – Uses GPT to explain vulnerabilities and recommend fixes.
- ⚙️ **Modular Agent Architecture** – Easily extendable agents for scanning, enrichment, and reporting.
- 🗂 **Risk Prioritization** – Automatically scores findings based on severity and likelihood.
- 📄 **Executive-Friendly Reports** – Converts technical results into clear summaries for leadership or audit.
- 🔁 **Feedback Loop** – Agents learn from past scan patterns to improve detection.

The main agent will:

Pull repo metadata from GitHub

Perform static analysis and basic checks

Ask the LLM to interpret issues and suggest fixes

Output a report (print, save, or export options)

🧠 Sample Use Cases
Scanning a new repository before deployment

Enhancing traditional scanners (e.g., Trivy, Snyk) with LLM insight

Generating audit-ready vulnerability summaries

Creating automated GitHub Actions for secure CI/CD
